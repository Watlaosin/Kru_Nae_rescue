Hello! It's me Wat. I dunno how to write a writeup so here's what i got

This project solves the robot navigation usinh OOP in java.
We control 3 robots Monkol, Somsri, and Somsak.
Monkol does not have any limit range, while Somsri and Somsak suffering from their defects limits
their maximum distace it could travel. Somsri can travel to a maxium of 8 blocks and Somsak can travel up to 4.

So i assigned points to them based on how far they can go.
Point (1,3) being the closest to the start gets assigned to Somsak.
Point (6,2) and point (4,4) are equally as far so either Monkol or Somsri can be assigned to,
but for me i choose point (6,2) for Somsri and point (4,4) for Monkol.

Overall, i think this is a nice project beacuse after trial and error, it makes me understand Java OOP
more deeply.
